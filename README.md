# Metis-Map-System

## Update

So far, templated blueprints for locations and moving players have been implemented, with code to update the rotation on the minimap. As well, locations can track when players pass through and update accordingly, although that functionality just prints a string at the moment.
There is still much more to do that will be done later, but feel free to at least view my progress so far.

Finishing the project will involve many late nights working, but here's a list of yet-to-be-implemented features:
- Map Screen
- Player Pings
- Location Logic
- Icon Visibility Adjustments
- Minimap Border Customization
- Map Screen Customization
- Custom Map Markers

There are no plans at the moment to make this plugin multiplayer-compatible.

## About

For my portfolio centerpiece solo project, I plan to add a map and minimap system which would feature beacon waypoints, custom waypoint pings, custom waypoint colors, and local feature recognition which would update and show on the map. As a programmer who enjoys and wants to find a role in systems, I believe map systems are a good portion of modern open-world games, and this project would also assert my skills in UI programming.

As for my choice of tools, I plan to use Unreal Engine 5’s latest version for this feature, as most unrelated items and frameworks such as character movement will already be present. As well, Unreal Engine has become a staple engine for a lot of game studios in the industry, and no matter how much work I’ve already done in Unreal, I can always gain more familiarity with it. As for other technologies, I plan to use Unreal’s Blueprint to implement logic for the map, as well as widgets for the UI components. There is also the possibility that I will use C++ within Unreal to implement some features.
 
I believe that the scope of this project is fairly stable with what I can do in a semester along with my other classes and activities. Committing to too many features can leave little room for polish, and a normal amount of features with tons of polish look much better than tons of features with no polish. This would also give me room to submit my work to the Fab Unreal Marketplace as a free public plugin for others to use. Potential issues would be my unfamiliarity with Unreal’s plugin uploading guidelines, as well as having to use Unreal’s C++ library. However, I anticipate that these issues will be minimized as there are plenty of resources available for me to use that solve both of these problems.
 
At the end of the project, I plan to show off my published plugin along with a feature demo video that will show off the main features of my system. If publication of the plugin goes awry, I will still create a video demo of my fully implemented system.
